	If your system is getting stuck during system boot, you can troubleshoot the system by booting it into rescue or emergency mode:
\bigskip
\begin{itemize}
	\item Append either \textbf{systemd.unit=rescue.target} or \textbf{systemd.unit=emergency.target} to the kernel command line to boot the system into a  rescue or emergency shell instead of starting normally. 
	\item Both of these shells require the root password. 
	\item The \textbf{emergency.target} keeps the root file system mounted read-only.

	\end{figure}
	
	\item The \textbf{rescue.target} waits for sysinit.target to complete first so that more of the system will be initialized, for example, logging, file systems, etc.

	\item Exiting from these shells will continue with the regular boot process.
